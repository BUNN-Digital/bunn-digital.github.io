The BUNN VirtualTOUCH API provides customer access to manage a VirtualTOUCH interaction with a BUNN machine. VirtualTOUCH allows end-users to make beverage selections, pay, and dispense from the convenience of their mobile device.

The VirtualTOUCH API allows customers to create their own user experience front-end but still access their BUNNlink-enabled machine through our easy-to-use API.
