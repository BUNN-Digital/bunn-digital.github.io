# Event Consumer

In order to use BUNN API Events, you will need to create and register an Event Consumer. This consumer must conform to our [standard event format](event-format) to ensure proper delivery. You can implement the consumer to listen/respond to events however you see fit.

As an example, we provide a [reference implementation using Java/Spring-Boot](https://github.com/BUNN-Digital/Event-Consumer-Reference-Implementation-Java).
